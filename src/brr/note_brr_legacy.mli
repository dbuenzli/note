(** Persistent storage.

    Persisent key-value store implemented over
    {{:http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/}webstorage}. Safe if no one
    tampers with the storage outside of the program.

    {b XXX.}
    {ul
    {- This still relies on the jsoo representation, add safer keys with type
    indexed codecs.}
    {- Provide something sensitive for storage events}} *)
module Store : sig

  (** {1 Storage scope} *)

  type scope = [ `Session | `Persist ]
  (** The storage scope. *)

  (** {1 Keys} *)

  type 'a key
  (** The type for keys whose lookup value is 'a *)

  val key : ?ns:Jstr.t -> unit -> 'a key
  (** [key ~ns ()] is a new storage key in namespace [ns]. If [ns]
      is unspecified, the key lives in a global namespace.

      {b Warning.} Reordering invocations of {!val-key} in the same
      namespace will most of the time corrupt existing storage. This
      means that all {!val-key} calls should always be performed at
      initialization time. {!Store.force_version} can be used to
      easily version your store and aleviate this problem. *)

  (** {1 Storage}

      In the functions below [scope] defaults to [`Persist]. *)

  val mem : ?scope:scope -> 'a key -> bool
  (** [mem k] is [true] iff [k] has a mapping. *)

  val add : ?scope:scope -> 'a key -> 'a -> unit
  (** [add k v] maps [k] to [v]. *)

  val rem : ?scope:scope -> 'a key -> unit
  (** [rem k] unbinds [k]. *)

  val find : ?scope:scope -> 'a key -> 'a option
  (** [find k] is [k]'s mapping in [m], if any. *)

  val get : ?scope:scope -> ?absent:'a -> 'a key -> 'a
  (** [get k] is [k]'s mapping. If [absent] is provided and [m] has
      not binding for [k], [absent] is returned.

      @raise Invalid_argument if [k] is not bound and [absent]
      is unspecified or if [scope] is not {!support}ed. *)

  val clear : ?scope:scope -> unit -> unit
  (** [clear ()], clears all mapping. *)

  val ev : unit event
  (** [ev] fires on storage changes. FIXME provide something
      sensitive, e.g. key watching. *)

  (** {1 Versioning} *)

  val force_version : ?scope:scope -> string -> unit
  (** [force_version v] checks that the version of the store is [v].  If
      it's not it {!clear}s the store and sets the version to [v]. *)
